"Build a full-stack Bus Management System with CRUD functionality. The backend should be developed using FastAPI, the frontend using ReactJS, and SQLite should be used for data storage. Implement user authentication with email and password, ensuring secure login and protected routes. The system should allow users to create, read, update, and delete bus records through a REST API. The UI should be beautifully designed with animations for smooth user interactions. Use SQLAlchemy for ORM and Pydantic for data validation in FastAPI. Ensure proper error handling, authentication, and API documentation using Swagger. The ReactJS frontend should be fully responsive and feature intuitive navigation with engaging animations to enhance user experience."
